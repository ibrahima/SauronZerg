Macro better
Don't make workers or zerglings if you're not on track for the build (i.e. hydra den by 24ish)
Don't mine as much gas at first, wait a little.

Apparently sometimes it loses count of workers when they die? O.o
Actually handle sparky probes, they suck.
Keep track of when builders die O_O
    Need to have it actually do something.
Double building perhaps
line 633 ->1019
340
The army WAITING state is retarded (runs past enemies or sits around doing nothing)
Cut back on zerglings unless you see early pressure

Still some weirdness with gas
Use zerglings for scouting.

Alternate between building army and building drones

Pull back overlords when you see corsairs
    Get a spire?

Pull back defending zerglings if the overlord dies.
